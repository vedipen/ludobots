# pyrosim: A python robot simulator. 

## Documentation
(Work in progress) documentation available [here](https://ccappelle.github.io/pyrosim/code.html)

Pyrosim enables the creation of robots with arbitrary body plans
and neural controllers, and the optimization of them in arbitrary simulated
environments.

## Installation instructions.

  Download or clone the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/jbongard/pyrosim).

  If you downloaded the zipped version, unzip the directory somewhere you can access it.

  Note: Pyrosim is intended for use with Python2.x. It does not yet run smoothly with Python3.x.

### For Windows users:

  Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)--a package that includes Python
  and useful Python libraries--if you don't already have it by 
  choosing `Download for Windows', the Python2.7 version, and the 64-bit version if you have
  a 64-bit machine and 32-bit otherwise. (You can find out whether you have a 32-bit or 64-bit
  machine [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15056/windows-7-32-64-bit-faq).)

  Now open the file called pyrosim.py in the pyrosim directory using your favorite text
  editor.

  Change line 20 from

  ```
  commandsToSend = ['./simulator']
  ```

  to

  ```
  commandsToSend = ['./simulator7.exe']
  ```

  if you have Windows 7 or 8, or change the line to 

  ```
  commandsToSend = ['./simulator10.exe']
  ```

  if you have a Windows 10 machine.

  Save the file and close it.

  Now open Demo_00_Empty_Sim.py, again using your favorite text editor, and change this line

  ```
  sim = PYROSIM() 
  ```

  to this

  ```
  sim = PYROSIM(evalTime=10000) 
  ```
  
  Save the file and close it.

  Now [open a command prompt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6UkfGafBGI)
  and [navigate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNXtttJUREk) into the Pyrosim directory.

  Now run Demo_00_Empty_Sim.py by typing

  ```
  c:\pyrosim> python Demo_00_Empty_Sim.py
  ```

  If you get an error message such as ```python: command not found```, this means
  that your computer does not know where to find the python interpreter.
  [Locate the directory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQcA47Mqcj4) 
  where you installed Anaconda. There should be a file called python.exe
  in there. Now 
  [change your path environment variable](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)
  to include the directory
  that contains python.exe. Execute ```c:\pyrosim> python Demo_00_Empty_Sim.py```
  again.

  When the command works, you should see a new window open onto
  an empty virtual environment, [like this](https://imgur.com/a/FNQpE).

  If that does not work, follow the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/tNGrxDftclA).

### For Mac and Linux users:

  Open a terminal window, and navigate into that directory. For example:

  ```bash
  $ cd ~/Desktop/pyrosim
  ```

  Run build.sh:

  ```bash
  $ sh build.sh
  ```

  This takes three to five minutes. The output should look like this:
  
  ```bash
  Unpacking ode-0.12.tar.bz2...done
  Building ode-0.12...done
  Building simulator...done
  ```

  If you are installing from Linux and you do not get the third
  `done' confirmation, install these additional packages

  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential
  $ sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
  ```

  then re-install Pyrosim:

  ```
  $ sh build.sh
  ```

  Once you get all three `done' confirmations, test the package by running
  ```bash
  $ python Demo_00_Empty_Sim.py 
  ```
  This should bring up an OpenGL window displaying an empty, virtual world.
  The window will close on its own after a few seconds.

### Next steps.

Now you can start making robots [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ludobots/wiki/pyrosim/simulation), starting at step #3.
